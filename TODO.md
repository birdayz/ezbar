# ezbar — roadmap & TODO

## ★ North star — toward the best bar ever

**Thesis:** ezbar has two assets no other bar has — **GPU rendering** and a **safe,
hot-reloadable plugin platform** — and today it uses about half of each. "Best bar
ever" is *not* more built-in modules or theme knobs (that's the waybar treadmill).
It's finishing those two things so the bar does what no other bar can: **feel alive
(motion) and let you build & interact (a real widget platform).**

Each bet runs the drill: RFC → review (2 subagents) → implement → review → commit → merge.

### P0 — make it alive (start here)
- [x] **Pointer events → interactive plugins** — **DONE** (RFC 0009, merged `7e223d5`).
  Host delivers press/right-press/scroll/enter/leave to the guest's `update(Event::Pointer)`
  through the reactor, bounded by the cadence gate + WALL/epoch. Buttons + scroll-to-adjust
  + hover. Drag/release deferred to an additive v0.2.0 WIT.
- [~] **Motion — first eased transition** — built (RFC 0010), **opt-in/default-off**
  (`[modules.workspaces].animate = true`). The original `window::frames()` driver broke hover
  in iced_layershell (frame-callback path corrupts the pointer-seat → `mouse hasn't entered`),
  a layershell-only failure the mainline-iced reviews couldn't catch — found by deploying live.
  Re-driven with `iced::time::every(16ms)` (no frame callbacks → shouldn't touch the seat) and
  gated off by default so the default bar's hover is known-safe. **Needs one live check:** flip
  `animate = true`, switch a workspace, confirm hover still opens popups (cursor warps can't
  tell the drivers apart — only a real hover does).

### P1 — finish the platform
- [x] **Event-driven cadence (`set_timeout`)** — **DONE** (RFC 0011). The reactor honors
  the frozen `host.set-timeout`: one-shot timer, re-armed per tick; a plugin that never
  arms keeps a legacy 2 s heartbeat, `set_timeout(0)` opts out to **zero** wakes. Killed the
  blind poll, added an immediate post-init bootstrap tick (chip paints at t≈0), surfaced
  `set_timeout` on the Rust `Ctx` (Go already had it) with an identical loud docstring, and
  migrated weather/btc/quakes off the 2 s poll (they were hammering open-meteo/Coinbase/USGS
  at 0.5 Hz) onto real cadences with error backoff.
- [~] **Safe host capabilities** so the powerful widgets *can* be plugins (RFC 0007
  showed they can't today). **Host-computed feeds: DONE** (RFC 0012) — a sandboxed plugin
  subscribes to `cpu/memory/temperature/battery/net` via `feed-subscribe`, the host samples
  once and fans out to all subscribers (idle = zero), capability-gated by
  `[modules.<id>].feeds`. The `sysgraph` example draws a live CPU graph with no `/proc`
  access — the thing RFC 0007 said was impossible. **Still TODO: read-only sway IPC**
  (workspaces/title) — needs a new `since-v0.2.0` WIT (not in the frozen surface), so it's
  its own RFC. The sandbox stays a sandbox.

### P2 — ecosystem
- [~] **Plugin registry + `ezbar install` + capability manifest** — **RFC 0014 Accepted**;
  **Phase A SHIPPED.** **A) DONE:** the **hash-keyed grant fix** (`src/grants.rs`, the security
  core — see CRIT below) + the **`ezbar:manifest` reader** (`ezbar_wasm::manifest`: parse the
  declared caps + warn on declared-but-ungranted; verified against a real component). **B)
  TODO — producer:** a `cargo ezbar package` that builds → appends `ezbar:manifest` (via
  `wasm-encoder`; `wasm-tools` 1.251 dropped `custom-section`) → emits `{id}.wasm` + sha256 +
  the `plugins/<id>/<v>.toml` entry. Until plugins actually *carry* a manifest, the host's
  declared-vs-granted check stays a warning (not enforcement) and the consent key stays
  `sha256(wasm)`. **C) TODO — registry:** git-backed per-plugin-versioned index +
  `install`/`update`/`list`/`remove`/`search` (TOFU publisher-pin, prebuilt+sha256, **print**
  the grant block, WIT-window negotiation). The network effect no other bar has.

- [~] **CRIT (security) — id-keyed grants → confused-deputy. Hash-binding DONE; manifest
  binding remains.** RFC 0006 §5 promised hash-keyed grants ("can't swap a benign manifest under
  a granted hash to escalate"), but the host keyed capability grants by the plugin **id** (= config
  key = `.wasm` stem). So a *different* `weather.wasm` under the same id inherited the existing
  `[modules.weather]` grant with no re-consent — a confused-deputy. (Trigger note, corrected: the
  config-dir watcher is `NonRecursive`, so a *bare* drop into the `plugins/` subdir does **not**
  auto-reload; the swap is picked up on the next config reload / `ezbar msg reload` / restart — and
  `PLUGINS` is a startup `OnceLock`, so a brand-new id needs a restart regardless. Still a real hole
  on any reload/restart; not literally "live on mtime".) **FIXED (RFC 0014 Phase A core):** the host
  now binds consent to the artifact's **content hash**, not its id — `src/grants.rs` keeps a
  host-owned `grants.toml` (`id -> sha256(wasm)`), TOFU on first sight, and **withholds every
  capability** when the on-disk bytes don't match the consented hash (the plugin still runs
  sandboxed); `ezbar grant <id>` re-approves after a legitimate rebuild. `build()` gates the grant
  args through `grants::decide()`; the reactor (the sandbox engine) is untouched — it enforces
  whatever grants it's handed. **Remaining (Phase B):** read an embedded `ezbar:manifest` and key on
  the domain-separated `hash(wasm ‖ manifest)` + "declared caps ≤ consented caps" — needs the
  `wasm-tools` emit step (Rust + TinyGo). (`src/grants.rs`, `src/modules/mod.rs`, `src/main.rs`.)

### P1 (cont.) — read-only sway IPC: **designed, ready to implement**
- [ ] **Read-only sway state** — **RFC 0013 Accepted** (both reviewers ACK after folding
  push→**pull**). Completes "safe capabilities": a plugin reads the workspace list + focused
  title via a `sway-snapshot() -> result<sway-state, string>` host call, capability-gated by
  `[modules.<id>].sway`. Forces the **first WIT version bump** (`since-v0.2.0`) + the
  frozen-version-window infra (RFC 0006 §4). Two phases:
  - [x] **Phase 1 — the version window — DONE.** `wit/since-v0.2.0` (pure copy + version
    bump); dual `bindgen!` with `types`/`ui`/`events` **remapped** to v0.1.0 (so `Tree`/`Event`
    and the whole drive loop/`lift`/render are shared — only `Plugin` + the `host` trait fork);
    `linker_v2`; `enum DrivenPlugin{V1,V2}`; version detection by introspecting the component's
    imported `ezbar:plugin/host@x.y`; v2 `host` impl delegates to v1 (v1 untouched). **Verified:
    v0.1.0 weather (78 popup nodes, unchanged) AND a v0.2.0 plugin both co-load on one binary.**
  - [x] **Phase 2 — sway-read — DONE (Rust).** `host.sway-snapshot() -> result<sway-state,
    string>` in the v0.2.0 WIT (records in `host`, not `types`, to keep the remap);
    `set_sway_source` injection in `main.rs` over `sources::sway::snapshot()`; the v2
    `sway_snapshot` host impl (gated by `[modules.<id>].sway`, synchronous `Err` denial);
    `Ctx::sway_snapshot()` in the Rust SDK (bumped to v0.2.0); the **`wintitle`** dogfood
    (v0.2.0) reads it and renders — verified, and weather (v0.1.0) unchanged. Read-only (no
    `run_command`). **Follow-up:** Go-SDK parity (needs the v0.2.0 Go bindings regenerated).

### Ongoing — reliability (table stakes)
- [ ] **Multi-monitor / hotplug / sway-reload hardening** + a regression harness for
  output churn (the two-bars saga bit us twice). Stunning-but-flaky ≠ best.

### Backlog from the reactor reviews (non-blocking)
- [ ] Wire `save_state`/`restore` across clean reloads, or drop them from the frozen WIT.
- [x] Cache eviction sweep — **DONE**. After publishing a fresh `.cwasm` (a plugin rebuilt),
  evict the oldest beyond a 24-artifact cap (`sweep_cache`), so the cache can't grow one
  ~MB file per rebuild forever. Self-healing: an evicted-but-active artifact recompiles once.
- [x] Capability matcher — **DONE**. `host_matches` normalizes case (DNS is
  case-insensitive) and treats a port-less grant as authorizing any port, while a
  `:port`-pinned grant must match exactly. Replaces the naive `grant == host` that rejected
  `API.Example.com` or an explicit `:443`. No implicit subdomain match (security). Tested.

### Anti-goals (the Linus part)
No chasing waybar's module count. No config knobs for zero users. Every hour on a
builtin nobody asked for is an hour stolen from the platform + the motion.

## Detailed backlog

Outstanding work, tagged by criticality. The bar is fully functional today, so there
are no **CRIT** items (nothing broken/crashing); the highest are promised-but-missing
features and config keys that silently do nothing.

**Legend:** `CRIT` broken/blocking · `HIGH` promised feature missing or misleading
behaviour · `MED` wanted feature / real gap · `LOW` polish / nice-to-have.

---

## Config & theming (RFC 0002)

- [~] **MED** — **Graph knobs — mostly DONE.** `[modules.<id>.graph]` now exposes
  `samples` · `width` · `height` · `line_width` · `fill` (+ the pre-existing `line_color`),
  resolved by `modules::graph_cfg` and clamped to sane bounds; defaults preserve the prior
  look exactly (per-module sample caps, 48×16, 1.5 px, filled). The `Graph` widget gained
  `line_width`/`fill`; a `Graph::new` keeps the reactor/tests on defaults. **Remaining:**
  `smooth` (Catmull-Rom on the metric sparklines) — deferred as a riskier rendering-character
  change. (`modules/{mod,cpu,memory,temperature,ping}.rs`, `ezbar_plugin::ui::graph`)
- [x] **HIGH** — **`[theme.workspaces]` per-state colours were parsed but unused → DROPPED.**
  The chip is fully themed by the global `[theme]` tokens (`accent`/`fg`/`fg_dim`/`urgent`)
  plus `[modules.workspaces].style`, so the parallel `focused/occupied/empty/urgent/colors/
  special` fields in `WorkspaceTheme` were vestigial config that lied — removed (re-wiring
  would just duplicate the global theming). `WorkspaceTheme` now carries only `style`.
  (`config.rs:WorkspaceTheme`)
- [x] **MED** — **Inline markup — DONE (both modules).** The themed `[c=token]…[/c]` /
  `[b]…[/b]` subset (RFC 0002) is a renderer-agnostic `modules::markup` (parse → coalesce →
  `rich_text` spans, theme-token colours, forgiving on malformed/literal brackets; parser +
  render both unit-tested). Wired into **`custom`** (a script colours its own output: `echo
  '[c=ok]up[/c]'`) and **`window_title`** via an optional `format = "[c=fg_dim]{title}[/c]"`
  — the markup is parsed ONCE off the trusted format and the title substituted AFTER, so a
  window title containing `[` is never interpreted (tested). Default (no `format`) renders the
  bare title byte-identically. (`modules/markup.rs`, `modules/custom.rs`, `modules/window_title.rs`)
- [x] **MED** — `[theme.workspaces].colors[]` / `special[]` — **removed** (were
  undocumented + unused; dropped with the other dead `WorkspaceTheme` fields).
- [ ] **LOW** — `[bar].radius` on the **solid** bar surface (margin/float shipped;
  rounding the solid slab needs the transparent-surface + rounded-container path).
- [ ] **LOW** — Per-output config (per-output `scale`/`height`/outputs) — deferred.
- [ ] **LOW** — `include = [...]` for the *whole* config (presets already cover theme).
- [x] **LOW** — `read_parse` policy **made consistent** — DONE. On *reload*, a missing/
  unreadable file now keeps-last-good (like a parse error), instead of flashing the live bar
  to defaults during an editor's atomic save. Startup `load()` still treats no-config as
  defaults (right for a fresh install). (`main.rs:read_parse`)

## Modules & SDK (RFC 0001 / 0003)

- [ ] **MED** — **`Service` layer for non-sway capabilities.** The sway service shares
  one connection; D-Bus/PipeWire need the same before Tier-B, ideally surfaced via
  `Ctx` so third-party plugins use it too (today a module opens its own client).
- [x] **MED** — **`custom` matched to ashell — DONE.** `listen_cmd` streaming (each stdout
  line updates the chip, `kill_on_drop`, gentle restart); `[[modules.<id>.icons]]` **regex→
  icon map** (first matching pattern swaps the glyph, else `icon`); `alert` **regex danger
  dot** (urgent-themed). Bad patterns are logged + skipped (no panic). Tested. (`modules/
  custom.rs`)
- [ ] **MED** — **Icon metric-normalization / per-glyph nudge table.** RFC says this
  "must not ship empty"; today icons rely on the raw font baseline. Promote to an
  `ezbar_plugin::ui` helper (`ctx.icon(Icon::…)`).
- [x] **LOW** — `graph_widget` helper DRYs the four metric views — **DONE**. The identical
  `canvas(Graph{…}).width().height()` block in cpu/memory/temperature/ping is now one
  `modules::graph_widget(gcfg, kind, values, line_color)`, so a graph change (size/stroke/
  fill, a future `smooth`) touches one spot, not four.
- [x] **LOW** — Workspaces **urgent pulse** restored — DONE. A `blink_on` toggle driven by
  a 500ms `time::every` armed ONLY while a workspace is urgent (gated like `calendar`; a calm
  bar arms no timer), alpha-dimming the urgent colour on the off-beat via a pure unit-tested
  `urgent_pulse()` so all four chip styles throb. (`modules/workspaces.rs`)
- [x] **LOW** — `ezbar msg volume` **routes through the volume module** now — DONE. The
  IPC/keybind path dispatches `ModuleMsg` to the volume instance (via `volume::adjust_msg`),
  which changes the level and refreshes its displayed value in one `update` (no lag waiting
  for the 1s poll). Falls back to poking the source directly only if no volume pill is
  placed. (`main.rs:VolumeAdjust`, `modules/volume.rs`)
- [ ] **LOW** — `clock` **weather**, sway **submap** module — RFC Tier-A leftovers.
- [x] **LOW** — `ipc_stream` **probe-before-unlink** — DONE. It now `connect()`s to an
  existing socket first; a live listener is left alone (the instance runs without IPC
  instead of hijacking it), and only a dead/stale socket is unlinked + rebound. Stops a
  second `ezbar` launch from silently stealing `ezbar msg` routing from the running bar.
- [x] **HIGH** — **WASM-plugin hover was dead on the solid bar — FIXED.** A WASM plugin's
  `view` emits no hover `mouse_area` (whole-pill hover is host-driven via `hover_messages` +
  the host wrapping the pill in `mouse_area(on_enter/on_exit)`). That wrapping existed ONLY in
  the **islands** branch of `bar_view`; the **solid** branch did a bare `build_widgets(g)`, so a
  plugin pill (e.g. `weather`) had no hover surface and its popup never opened — while built-ins
  (`stock`) hovered fine (they wrap their own `mouse_area`), which is exactly why it read as a
  WASM-only bug. Factored into `with_pill_hover(group, widgets)`, now called from BOTH branches.
  (Note: the layershellev `mouse hasn't entered` seat warnings seen while chasing this were a
  red herring — built-in hover worked throughout.) (`main.rs:bar_view`, `with_pill_hover`)
- [ ] **LOW** — Module instance ids restart at 1 on rebuild (harmless per review, but
  identity isn't stable across reorders).

## Tier-B desktop stack (RFC 0003 — "expensive, demand-gated")

- [~] **MED** — **`media` (MPRIS now-playing) DONE; `tray` remaining.** The `media` module
  shells out to `playerctl` (dependency-free, like `ping`/`battery`) for status/artist/title
  from any MPRIS player — click = play/pause (with an immediate state read-back), scroll =
  skip, hidden when nothing plays, change-gated renders. Opt-in (`[modules.media]`, not in
  default placement). A richer D-Bus version (album art + the shared `Service` layer) and
  **`tray`** (StatusNotifierItem) still want the `Service` layer. (`modules/media.rs`,
  `sources/media.rs`)
- [ ] **MED** — **OSD** (volume/brightness transient overlay), driven by `ezbar msg
  volume/brightness …` + widget interaction.
- [ ] **LOW** — `privacy` (PipeWire mic/cam/screenshare dots).
- [ ] **LOW** — `settings` quick-panel (audio sink/source + brightness sliders first;
  power menu / peripheral battery / idle-inhibitor after).
- [ ] **LOW** — `network` (WiFi scan + password dialog) + `bluetooth` — demand-gated,
  largest lift, most duplicative of existing applets.
- [ ] **LOW** — `notifications` daemon — acquire `org.freedesktop.Notifications`
  **without replace**, refuse-if-mako/swaync-owned.

## Testing & docs

- [~] **MED** — **Integration/runtime tests — started.** The **placement resolver**
  (`desired_module_specs`) is now covered: default set (workspaces leads, clock end-cap),
  per-key dedup, explicit-zone override of defaults, and chrome (`switcher`) never resolving
  as a module. **Remaining:** the live-wiring loops (file-watch reload keeps the active
  preset, module set rebuilds on placement change, multi-instance routing) — these need
  test seams around the iced `update`/reconcile, not just pure functions.
- [x] **LOW** — Per-module config reference — DONE. `docs/config-reference.md` tabulates every
  `[modules.<id>]` key + default for all built-ins, the shared `[graph]` sub-table, the WASM
  capability grants, and the inline-markup tokens; linked from the README (which also no longer
  claims ping's target is hardcoded).
- [ ] **LOW** — A GIF of the live `▾` switcher cycling presets for the README /
  r/unixporn post (a still doesn't convey "no restart").
- [x] **LOW** — RFC statuses updated: 0002/0003/0004/0005 → **Implemented** (were "Draft").
  0007 stays **Draft** (genuinely pending the port-list decision). The rest already carried
  Accepted/Implemented/their runtime-state.
